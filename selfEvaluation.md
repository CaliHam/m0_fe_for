# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
    - I feel fairly confident in my understand, but less confident with fluency and being able to repeat or explain it in the correct terminology.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
    - I had a definite struggle in teaching myself and wanting to skip over some of the practices; but I persevered after taking a quick breather. 
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
    - I am going to wake up earlier tomorrow and go through more practice problems.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
    - If i have anymore questions I know i=I can go to my group or office hours
